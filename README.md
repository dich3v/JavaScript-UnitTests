# JavaScript-UnitTests

This repository contains practice JavaScript functions along with their corresponding unit tests.  
The purpose is to demonstrate proficiency with JavaScript basics, ES modules, and test automation using Mocha and Chai.

## What’s Included

- Custom functions written in modern JavaScript (ES6+)
- Unit tests using **Mocha** as the test runner and **Chai** for assertions
- Clean folder structure:
  - `scripts/` – contains the source `.js` files
  - `test/` – contains matching test files (same name + `Tests.js`)

## How to Run the Tests

1. Make sure you have **Node.js** and **npm** installed
2. Install dependencies:

   npm install

Run all tests:

    npm test

All test files are written using ES Modules, so "type": "module" is set in package.json.

## Tools Used

- **Mocha** – test framework  
- **Chai** – assertion library  
- **Node.js** – runtime  
- **VS Code** – IDE
